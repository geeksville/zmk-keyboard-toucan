# Defaults to 15 minutes but 60 minutes is only very slightly more power draw and user experience is much better to not
# have keyboard go to deep sleep (i.e. having to reconenect to bluetooth)
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_SLEEP_TIMEOUT=3600000  

# This is for 'regular' ZMK idle behavior.  Default is 30000 (30 seconds) but since this board is essentially powering
# only a nice-view and a touchpad, there is zero user visible behavior change to going to idle much more quickly.
# This helps A LOT with touchpad power consumption (only 1.7mA idle vs 2.9mA active).  The only user visible aspect is
# that the touchpad needs 300ms to start seeing touches when next pressed - but this behavior is suppressed if we 
# have pressed a keyboard key within the last 10 seconds (highly likely).
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT=10000

# We use this because we need ZMK_PM, PM_DEVICE and ZMK_PM_DEVICE_SUSPEND_RESUME to get proper sleep notifications into the cirque driver
# since we need all that might as well also turn on SOFT_OFF (which implies all these things but adds an optional SOFT_OFF feature)
